<h1 align="center">Hello!! 👋, I'm Pedro!</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a mechanical engineer, holding a degree from the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU), and I also obtained my master's degree at the same institution, with a focus on manufacturing processes, especially in the area of machining.</h3>


🔍 I'm passionate about research and discovering results through it. Throughout my academic journey, I extensively used statistics and result analysis in my research. The pursuit of knowledge and a deeper understanding of processes has always been my driving force.

🌱 Currently, I'm broadening my horizons and venturing into the world of machine learning. I'm excited to apply my experience in data analysis and academic research to solve problems and make discoveries in the field of data science.

💬 Feel free to ask me about SQL, Python, Matlab, C, S, Statistics, Similarity Methods, Optimization or anything related to machine learning (Machine Learning). I'm always interested in sharing knowledge and learning new things!
